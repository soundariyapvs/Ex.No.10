# Ex.No.10
Content Creation (Reports, Articles, Case Studies, etc.) Using Prompt Patterns

## Date: 12/11/2025
## Reg. No. 212222060249

## Aim:
## To demonstrate how various prompting techniques (query decomposition, decision-making, semantic filtering, etc.) can be employed to create content such as reports, articles, case studies, or creative works like comic books, using ChatGPT or similar models. The objective is to highlight how different prompt structures affect the content's quality, coherence, and structure.

## Procedure:
1.	Introduction to Prompt Patterns: Begin by understanding the following prompt patterns:
○	Query Decomposition: Breaking down complex queries into smaller, actionable parts.
○	Decision Making: Asking the model to choose between options or directions.
○	Answer Engineering: Refining outputs by giving detailed instructions on how to structure or format the answer.
○	Fact Check List: Ensuring the content is factually accurate, especially for reports or case studies.
○	Tail Generation: Extending the content logically to create depth in storytelling or analysis.
○	Menu Actions: Presenting multiple action choices and guiding the AI to select one.
○	Semantic Filter: Applying filters to control the tone, style, and accuracy of the content.
2.	Choosing the Content Type: Decide on the type of content you want to create. This could be:
○	Reports (e.g., industry analysis, sustainability reports, etc.)
○	Case Studies (e.g., business solutions, technological innovations)
○	Articles (e.g., opinion pieces, educational articles)
○	Creative Content (e.g., comic book story, short stories, video scripts)
3.	For example, you could choose a business report on market trends, a case study on a successful startup, or even a story-based prompt like creating a fictional world for a comic.
4.	Creating the Prompts:
○	Start with simple prompts to generate initial content.
○	Gradually refine the prompts, moving toward more complex techniques like decision-making (asking the model to pick one of several options), tail generation (extending the narrative), and semantic filtering (adjusting style or tone).
5.	Generating and Refining Outputs: Use the model to generate initial drafts, and then refine the outputs using iterative adjustments:
○	For a report, prompt the model with basic data, then ask for a deeper analysis and insights.
○	For creative content, refine the initial story idea with specific details on characters, settings, or actions.
6.	Review and Evaluation: After generating content, evaluate the outputs for:
○	Coherence: Is the generated content logical and structured?
○	Creativity/Originality: Is the content engaging and fresh?
○	Accuracy: Is the content factually accurate (for reports and case studies)?
○	Tone and Style: Does the content match the intended tone (formal, creative, educational)?

## Test Case Scenarios for Content Generation
## Topic 1: Educational Report on Renewable Energy
1. First Draft (Basic Prompt)

Prompt:
“Write a short report about renewable energy and why it is important.”

Generated Output (Sample):
Renewable energy is energy that comes from natural sources such as sunlight, wind, and water. It is important because it helps reduce pollution and global warming. Renewable energy sources are sustainable and will not run out, unlike fossil fuels. Governments and organizations are working to promote the use of renewable energy to protect the environment and ensure energy security.

2. Refined Content (Advanced Prompt)

Prompt:
“Generate an educational report on renewable energy focusing on its types, global importance, and impact on sustainable development. Structure the report into Introduction, Types, Benefits, Challenges, and Conclusion.”

Generated Output (Sample):
Introduction:
Renewable energy refers to energy derived from natural processes that are replenished constantly. As the world faces energy and climate crises, renewable sources have become critical to sustainability.

Types of Renewable Energy:

Solar Energy: Uses sunlight to generate power through photovoltaic cells.

Wind Energy: Converts wind flow into mechanical energy using turbines.

Hydropower: Generates electricity through water flow in dams and rivers.

Biomass and Geothermal: Use organic materials and Earth’s heat for energy production.

Benefits:

Reduces greenhouse gas emissions

Provides sustainable and clean power

Encourages energy independence

Challenges:

High initial setup cost

Intermittent supply (e.g., solar and wind)

Requires infrastructure development

Conclusion:
Renewable energy plays a vital role in creating a sustainable and cleaner future. Continuous technological advancement and global collaboration will further enhance its adoption.

3. Multiple Versions (Prompt Iterations)
Prompt Version	Description	Effect on Output
V1	“Write about renewable energy and its benefits.”	General, lacks structure and depth.
V2	“Explain different types of renewable energy with examples.”	More detailed, factual improvement.
V3	“Create a structured educational report with introduction, benefits, and challenges.”	Produces organized and academic-style output.
4. Final Version (Polished Content)

After refining prompts and reviewing for clarity and factual accuracy:

Final Output:
Renewable energy represents the cornerstone of global sustainability efforts. It includes energy from the sun, wind, water, and biomass. The adoption of renewable sources has increased due to environmental concerns and technological advancements.
